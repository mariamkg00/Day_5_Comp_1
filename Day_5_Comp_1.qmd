## Explore the starwars dataset

look at the first six lines, find the dimensions of starwars, make a histogram of character heights, and make a scatter plot of height vs. weight

```{r}
head(starwars)
tail(starwars)

#making a histogram of character heights
ggplot(data= starwars, aes(x=height))+
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill= "yellow")

#making a scatter plot of height vs. weight
ggplot(data= starwars, aes(x=height, y= mass))+
  geom_jitter(aes(color=species))
```
